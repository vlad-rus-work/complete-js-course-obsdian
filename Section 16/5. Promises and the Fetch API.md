### What are promises?
- An object that is used as a placeholder for the future result of an asynchronous operation.
- We no longer need to rely on events and callbacks passed into asynchronous functions to handle asynchronous results.
- Instead of nesting callbacks, we can <mark style="background: #650BB3;">chain promises</mark> for a sequence of asynchronous operations: <mark style="background: #650BB3;">escaping callback hell</mark>.

### The promise lifecycle
1. Pending - Before the future value is available
- Async task
2. Settled - Async task finished
	- Fulfilled - Success
	- Rejected - An error happened
- We are able to handle these different states in our code.
- A promise is only settled once.
- Consume - When we already have a promise 
- Build Promise (e.g. Fetch API returns promise) - Consume Promise (e.g. promise returned from Fetch API.).
