Every ==value== is an object or primitive value.
<h3>7 primitive data types</h3>
1. Number - floating point numbers.
2. String - sequence of characters - used for text.
3. Boolean - Logical data type that can be either true or false - used for taking decisions.
4. Undefined - Value taken by a variable that is not yet defined (ex. let children;).
5. Null - Also means 'empty value'.
6. Symbol - Value that is unique and cannot be changed.
7. BigInt - Larger integers than the Number type can hold.

JavaScript has ==dynamic typing== - We do not have to manually define the data type, defined automatically.
