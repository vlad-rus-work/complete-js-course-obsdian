Scoping
- How our program's variables are <mark style="background: #650BB3;">organized</mark> and <mark style="background: #650BB3;">accessed</mark>. "Where do variables live?"
Lexical scoping
- Scoping is controlled by <mark style="background: #650BB3;">placement</mark> of functions and blocks in the code
Scope
- Space or environment in which a certain variable is <mark style="background: #650BB3;">declared</mark> (variable environment in case of functions). There is <mark style="background: #650BB3;">global</mark> scope, <mark style="background: #650BB3;">function</mark> scope and <mark style="background: #650BB3;">block</mark> scope
Scope of a variable
- Region of our code where a certain variable can be <mark style="background: #650BB3;">accessed</mark>

#### Global Scope
- Outside of <mark style="background: #650BB3;">any</mark> function or block
- Variables declared in global scope can be accessed <mark style="background: #650BB3;">everywhere</mark>

#### Function Scope
- Variables are accessible only <mark style="background: #650BB3;">inside functions</mark>, <mark style="background: #650BB3;">NOT</mark> outside
- Also called local scope

#### Block Scope
- Variables are accessible only inside blocks (block scoped)
- <mark style="background: #650BB3;">HOWEVER</mark>, this only applies to let and const variables
- Functions are <mark style="background: #650BB3;">also block scoped</mark> (only in strict mode)

#### Scope Chain
- Scope has access to variables from all <mark style="background: #650BB3;">outer scopes</mark>
Variable Lookup
- If a scope needs a variable, it will first look inside it's own scope, then check for all the outer scopes, in order
- Variables are not copied from one scope to another
- Scopes CANNOT look down in the inner scopes for variables
- var is <mark style="background: #650BB3;">function</mark> scoped, let and const are <mark style="background: #650BB3;">block</mark> scoped

### Scope Chain vs. Call Stack
- Scope Chain - Order in which functions are <mark style="background: #650BB3;">written in the code</mark>
	- Has <mark style="background: #650BB3;">nothing</mark> to do with the order in which they were <mark style="background: #650BB3;">called</mark>
