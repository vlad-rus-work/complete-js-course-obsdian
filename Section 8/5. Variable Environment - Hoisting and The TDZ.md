Hoisting
- Makes some types of variables accessible/usable in the code before they are actually declared. "Variables lifted to the top of their scope"
- Behind the scenes - Before execution, code is scanned for variable declarations, and for each variable, a new property is created in the variable environment object

| Name                           | Hoisted?                             | Initial Value                           | Scope                             |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| function declaration           | Yes                                  | Actual function                         | Block(in strict mode)             |
| var variables                  | Yes                                  | undefined                               | Function                          |
| let and const variables        | No (Technically yes, in practice no) | uninitialized, TDZ (Temporal Dead Zone) | Block                             |
| function expression and arrows | Depends if using var or let/const    | Depends if using var or let/const       | Depends if using var or let/const |
Temporal Dead Zone 
- The state where variables are un-reachable. They are in scope, but they aren't declared.

Variables declared with var will create a property on the global window object.
