1. High-Level
	1. We do not have to worry about memory management, it is done automatically by the computer
2. Garbage-collected
	1. JS automatically cleans the memory, so we don't have to
3. Interpreted or just-in-time compiled
	1. Converts to machine code inside the JS engine
4. Multi-paradigm
	1. Paradigm - An approach and mindset of structuring code, which will direct your coding style and technique
		1. Procedural programming
		2. Object-oriented programming (OOP)
		3. Functional programming (FP)
	2. Imperative vs Declarative
5. Prototype-based object-oriented
	1. Array is a prototype, on which we build our own arrays upon. Our arrays inherit methods from the prototype
6. First-class functions
	1. In a language with <mark style="background: #650BB3;">first-class functions</mark>, functions are simply <mark style="background: #650BB3;">treated as variables</mark>. We can pass them into other functions, and return them from functions.
7. Dynamic
	1. No data type definitons. Types become known at runtime
	2. Data type of variable is automatically changed
8. Single-threaded and non-blocking event loop
	1. Concurrency model - How the JS engine handles multiple tasks happening at the same time
	2. JavaScript runs in one <mark style="background: #650BB3;">single thread</mark>, so it can only do one thing at a time.
	3. Event loop - takes long running tasks, executes them in the "background", and puts them back in the main thread once they are finished
	4. Thread - Place where the computer runs our code
