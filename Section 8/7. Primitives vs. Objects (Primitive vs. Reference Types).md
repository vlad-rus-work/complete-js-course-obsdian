Primitive types and reference types
### Primitve types are stored in the execution context in which they are defined, for simplicity sake in the call stack, and reference types in the heap

- When we declare a primitve type, JS will create an unique identifier with the variable name, then a piece of memory will be allocated with a certain address (ex. 0001), and the value will be stored in memory at the specified address (ex. let age = 30 | Identifier = age; Address = 0001, Value = 30).
- The identifier points to the address, not to the value itself.
- A second variable equal to the first one actually just points to the address of the first variable.
- The value at a certain address is immutable, meaning it cannot be changed. 
- Mutating a variable's value will create a new memory address with a new value.

- When a new object is created it is stored in the heap.
- The identifier for the object will point to a memory address in the call stack, its value being a reference to the memory address in the Heap.
- A second object that points to the first object will point to the memory address in the call stack, <mark style="background: #650BB3;">NOT</mark> in the heap, meaning any change done on the second object will also be refelcted on the first object.
- const works as "expected" only for primitive values.
