- Is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects.
	- Paradigm - style of the code, "how" we write and organize code
- We use objects to <mark style="background: #650BB3;">model</mark> (describe) real-world (user or todo list item) or abstract (HTML component or data structure) features.
- Objects may contain data (properties) and code (methods). By using objects, we pack <mark style="background: #650BB3;">data and the corresponding behaviour</mark> into one block.
- In OOP, objects are self-contained pieces/blocks of code.
- Objects are building blocks of applications, and interact with one another.
- Interactions happen through a public interface (API): methods that the code <mark style="background: #650BB3;">outside</mark> of the object can access and use to communicate with the object.
- OOP was developed with the goal of <mark style="background: #650BB3;">organizing</mark> code, to make it <mark style="background: #650BB3;">more flexible and easier to maintain</mark> (avoid "spaghetti code"). 

### Classes and Instances (Traditional OOP)
#### Class  
- Like a blueprint from which we can create new objects.
#### Instance 
- A real object that we can use in our code which was created from a class(which isn't an object).
