- Using a plus sign operator on a string that is only numbers turns it into a number (ex. +'23' => 23)
- Number.parseInt() -> Has 2 arguments, 1. the string to convert; 2. in what base we are working with. The string needs to start with a number
- Number.parseFloat() -> Does the same thing as the parseInt()
- Number.isNaN() -> Checks if value is NaN
- Number.isFinite() -> Best way to check for a number
- Number.isInteger()
