- setTimeout takes in 2 obligatory arguments, the function and the time after which it will execute said function, after that it can take n arguments.
- A better way of passing argumets is by using an array, and then using the spread operator on said array in the function arguments.
- Only executed once
- setInterval instead executes the function every n second(n * 1000 milisecond)
