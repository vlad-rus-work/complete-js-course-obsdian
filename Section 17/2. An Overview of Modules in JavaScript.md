Module
- Reusable piece of code that encapsulates implementation details.
- Usually a standalone file, but it doesn't have to be the case.
- Whatever we export from a module is called a public API.
- Importing modules - dependencies

#### Why modules
- Compose software - Modules are small building blocks that we put together to build complex applications.
- Isolate components - Modules can be developd in isolation without thinking about the entire codebase.
- Abstract code - Implement low-level code in modules and import these abstractions into other modules.
- Organized code - Modules naturally lead to a more organized codebase.
- Reuse code - Modules allow us to easily reuse the same code, even across multiple projects.

### Native JavaSciprt (ES6) Modules
- Modules stored in files, exactly one module per file.

|                     | ES6 Modules          | Script        |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | ------------- |
| Top Level Variables | Scoped to module     | Global        |
| Default mode        | Strict               | "Sloppy" mode |
| Top-level this      | undefined            | window        |
| Imports & exports   | Yes                  | No            |
| HTML linkin         | script type = module | script        |
| File downloading    | Asynchronous         | Synchronous   |

### How ES6 Module are imported
- Modules are imported synchronously.
- Possible thanks to top-level("static") imports, which make imports known before execution.
- This makes bundling and dead code elimination possible.
