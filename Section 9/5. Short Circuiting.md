- The result of an OR ( || ) or AND ( && ) operator doesn't have to be a boolean.
Logical operators can use ANY data type, return ANY data type, do short-circuiting
- Short circuiting 
	- In the case of the OR operator, if the first value is a truthy value, it will immediatly return that first value or the last one if all of the values are falsy
	- In the case of the AND operator, if the first value is a falsy value, it will immediatly return that first value or the last one if all of the values are truthy
	- We can use the OR operator to set defaut values and the AND operator to execute code in the second operand if the first one is true
