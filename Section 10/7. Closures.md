- Makes a function remember all the variables that existed at the function's birthplace.
- Any function always has access to the variable environment of the execution context in which the function was created.
- <mark style="background: #650BB3;">CLOSURE</mark> 
	- VE attached to the function, exactly as it was at the time and place the function was created
	- <mark style="background: #650BB3;">Priority</mark> over the scope chain

1. A closure is the closed-over variable environment of the execution context in which a function was created, even after that execution context is gone.
2. A closure gives a function access to all the variables of its parent functions, even after that parent functions has returned. The function keeps a reference to its outer scope, which preserves the scope chain throughout time.

Closures are not tangible JavaScript objects.
