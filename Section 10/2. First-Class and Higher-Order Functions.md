### First-Class functions
- JS treats functions as <mark style="background: #650BB3;">first-class citizens</mark>
- This means that functions are <mark style="background: #650BB3;">simply values</mark>
- Functions are just another "type" of object

- Store functions in variables of properties
- Pass functions as arguments to OTHER functions
- Return functions FROM functions
- Call methods on functions

### Higher-Order functions
- A function that <mark style="background: #650BB3;">reveices</mark> another function as an argument, that <mark style="background: #650BB3;">returns</mark> a new function, or <mark style="background: #650BB3;">both</mark>
- This is only possible because of first-class functions

1. Function that receives another function
```
const greet = () => console.log('Hey Vlad);
btnClose.addEventListener('click', greet);
```

addEventListener - Higher-order function 
greet - Callback function - Will be called later by the HOF

2. Function that returns a new function
```
function count() {
let counter = 0;
return function() {
counter++;
	}
}
```

Higher-Order Functions are extremely helpful because they create <mark style="background: #650BB3;">Abstraction</mark>. 
- Abstractions in programming means leaving the details of a specific thing to other low level functions.
