- The event is generated at the root of the document
1. Capturing phase - The event travels from the document root to the target element.
2. Target phase - Events can be handled right at the target; Event listeners wait for a certain event to happen on a certain element, and as soon as the event occurs it runs the attached callback function.
3. Bubbling phase - Event travels up back to the document root, through every parent element.

- It's as if the event happened in each parent element
- This does not happen on all events
- Events propagate
